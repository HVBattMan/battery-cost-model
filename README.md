Site is live at bit.ly/batterycost! 

This web app allows users to model the cost of lithium ion battery by inputting their own cell and price parameters and calculating the total price of the cell. 

What happens to the cost of batteries if the cathode price goes down by 20%? What about the anode or electrolyte? What about if someone discovers a new cathode that holds twice as much energy? This app lets users find out!
